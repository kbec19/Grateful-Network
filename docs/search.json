The group’s “American Beauty,”\r\n“Europe ’72” and “In the Dark” are its only discs to top 2 million in\r\nsales. Instead, the Dead were known to dominate the touring world: They\r\nwere the highest-grossing act of 1993 pulling in $45.6 million, and\r\n$52.4 million in 1994.\r\nMeriwether, N. G. (Ed.). (2012). Reading the grateful dead : A\r\ncritical survey. Scarecrow Press.\r\nSo the Deadheads did something really fascinating. In the absence of\r\nordained dogma coming down ex cathedra, they glommed on to song order: a\r\nset of phenomena— just phenomena, like baseball statistics. I don’t know\r\nwhy. We didn’t know our own song orders, I swear to God! And maybe that\r\nwas the reason: The Deadheads did. I swear, sometimes Deadheads actually\r\ncontrolled the set list far more than they knew, just because they\r\nbelieved that something else was going to happen next, and the band\r\nsaid, “Oh well, what do you want to play? Oh, OK.” Somehow that would be\r\ntransmitted from the Deadheads, and maybe that’s why they thought that\r\nwas where the holiness was. (Barlow, p 33)\r\nOf course, for fans, it has always been the live performances of\r\nthese songs that made them resonate so deeply. As one early academic\r\nresearcher asserted, “One cannot learn ‘to do Dead’ from the tapes,\r\nhowever. Actual initiation must occur in the concert environment”\r\n(Pearson, thesis 20). Though this charge has been leveled by earlier\r\ngenerations of critics addressing other musical genres, and while some\r\nDeadheads— especially those in foreign countries— might disagree, all\r\nDeadheads would agree that live performances were the raison d’être of\r\nthe band. 14 Over the course of thirty years, the Dead played more than\r\n2,300 concerts for an audience estimated at twenty-five million,\r\npossibly the largest of any band in American history. 15 What is\r\nimportant about those statistics is what they conceal: The Dead never\r\nplayed the same show twice. Throughout their career, the goal was to\r\ncourt the muse of collective improvisation and see where she led; this\r\nlay at the heart of why fans went to show after show, year after year.\r\n16 It also explains a large part of the appeal of studying the Dead— and\r\nit certainly explains the central artifact in Dead studies, the concert\r\nrecordings. Early in the band’s career, band members recognized the\r\nimportance of taping their performances: They listened to them after the\r\ngigs in order to improve, and to mine them for especially evocative\r\nphrases and passages for later use in new compositions. 17 Fans wanted\r\nto remember, too, and began making their own tapes very early in the\r\nband’s career. 18 That practice mushroomed over the years and created an\r\nimmense body of evidence that now makes possible a great deal of work.\r\nAs one scholar commented, “As tapes represent one of the few artifacts\r\nrecoverable from the concert experience, they can be considered a source\r\nof ‘hard data’ in the research enterprise” (Pearson, “Ethnomethodology”\r\n429). Between the band’s own voluminous archive of concert recordings,\r\nthe source of more than a hundred releases to date, and the many, many\r\nthousands of live tapes made by fans, the number of recordings available\r\nto researchers is remarkable. 19 A higher percentage of the Rolling\r\nStones’ performances may have been recorded— but the oeuvre of the Dead,\r\nthe number of performances they played, and, most of all, the variations\r\nin set list and performance are far greater. In academic terms, no other\r\nrock band is so well documented— and no other rock band’s music and\r\napproach to performance merits such attention. (Meriwether, p 40)\r\nI believe that the Grateful Dead’s music is actually part of a\r\nlifeworld created by active listeners. This lifeworld is learned, either\r\nfrom hearing Grateful Dead music on numerous occasions, or from being\r\nopen to hear the music in a certain way” (Ganter 176). Band members said\r\nas much in interviews over the years. Garcia stated unequivocally that\r\nhe’d “never experienced the click of great music without an audience. .\r\n. . We exist by their grace” (McNally, A Long Strange Trip 389). Even\r\nnormally taciturn drummer Bill Kreutzmann told band biographer Dennis\r\nMcNally that “when it’s really happening, the audience is as much a part\r\nof the band as the band is the audience. There is no difference. The\r\naudience should be paid— they contribute as much” (389). Not\r\nsurprisingly, the most vivid description was written by lyricist Robert\r\nHunter, in a long public letter: When the Dead are playing their best,\r\nblood drips from the ceiling in great, rich drops. Together we do a kind\r\nof suicide in music which requires from each of us just enough\r\ninformation short of dropping the body to inquire into those spaces from\r\nwhich come our questions. It is partly about how living might occur in\r\nthe shadow of certain death; that death is satisfactory or\r\nunsatisfactory according to how we’ve lived and what we yield. The\r\ncontemplation of death for the unfulfilled is a nightmare, and it is\r\ngood that it should be. The vision of life without a great deal of\r\nresponsibility is hollow. Satisfaction in itself is nothing to be\r\nsought, it’s simply an excretion of the acceptance of responsibility.\r\n(“Robert Hunter, Dark Star” 53) (Meriwether, p 44)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
