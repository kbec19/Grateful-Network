# Grateful Network

## Data on the network of song writers that contributed to the Grateful Dead original songbook

This repository consists of working data in different formats that can lead to the creation of a researchable network. 

There are 26 songwriters that contributed to the *original* songs played over the course of the Grateful Dead touring history. This is the starting point for my data gathering.

There is always room for competing opinions when it comes to any aspect of the Grateful Dead - but my current working total of original songs represented in this data is 183* songs. There is room for future analysis into whether a "reprise" counts as another song, whether a "jam" of some type has an official or unofficial name, and much more.

There is also information that represents the point of view of multiple archivists in tallying the number of times each of the songs was played live in the 30 years of touring of the Grateful Dead, including my own.

More information to come as this repository is developed!

Currently, I have published a github page chronicling the creation of igraph and statnet network objects using the affiliation matrix. More to come as I continue to build the database and knowledge!
