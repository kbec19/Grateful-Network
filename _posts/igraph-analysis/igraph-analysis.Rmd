# Loading Networks

I previously analyzed the network using igraph and statnet, and need to make a decision about which package serves the network best. 

## Affiliation Matrix

Loading the dataset and creating the network to begin my analysis:

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
gd_affiliation <- read.csv('gd_affiliation_matrix.csv', row.names = 1, header = TRUE, check.names = FALSE)
gd_matrix <- as.matrix(gd_affiliation)
```

## Bipartite Projection

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
gd_projection <- gd_matrix%*%t(gd_matrix)
write.csv(gd_projection, file = "gd_projection.csv")
```

## Create igraph Object

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
set.seed(11)
gd_igraph <- graph.adjacency(gd_projection,mode="undirected", weighted = NULL)
```

## Create statnet Object

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(11)
gd_statnet <- as.network(gd_projection,
               directed = FALSE, 
               bipartite = FALSE,
               loops = FALSE,
               connected = TRUE)
```

# Loading Data

## Centrality and Node Data

I am going to load the data frame I saved from both igraph and statnet package analysis as well as a dataframe with key comparable results from each package

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
gd_ig_nodes <- read.csv("gd_ig_nodes.csv")
gd_stat_nodes <- read.csv("gd_stat_nodes.csv")
gd_compare <- read.csv("gd_comparison_packages.csv")
```

## Correlations of Centrality Measures

### Degree

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
degree_lm <- lm(igraph_degree~statnet_degree, data = gd_compare)
summary(degree_lm)
```

### Eigenvector Centrality

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
eigen_lm <- lm(ig_eigen~stat_eigen, data = gd_compare)
summary(eigen_lm)
```

### Betweenness

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
between_lm <- lm(ig_between~stat_between, data = gd_compare)
summary(between_lm)
```

### Closeness

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
close_lm <- lm(ig_close~stat_close, data = gd_compare)
summary(close_lm)
```

### Bonacich Power

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
bonpow_lm <- lm(ig_bonpow~stat_bonpow, data = gd_compare)
summary(bonpow_lm)
```

### Evaluation

There is high, nearly perfect in some cases, correlation in the scores given by the igraph and statnet packages in most measures. The largest differences are in the Bonacich power scores. The other difference, and most significant for my purposes, is the degree centrality scores. Although they are statistically correlated to a high degree, I have no independent way to verify which evaluation is "correct", so I will go forward using both networks depending on the needs of the task and capabilities of the packages.

## Structural Equivalence

Creating the matrix element then taking a look at the summary using the equivalence function "sedist", the default measure of assessing the approximate structural equivalence of actors, or "complete".

### "Complete"

```{r, code_folding=TRUE}
#calculate equivalence from specified distance marix
gd_stat_se<-equiv.clust(gd_statnet, equiv.fun="sedist", method="hamming",mode="graph")
```

```{r, code_folding=TRUE}
#summary of object produced by sedist()
#summary(gd_stat_se)
#plot equivalence clustering
plot(gd_stat_se,labels=gd_stat_se$glabels)
```

I need to look at the other methods of clustering as well. 

### "Average"

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
#with average cluster.method
gd_avg_se<-equiv.clust(gd_statnet, equiv.fun="sedist", cluster.method="average", method="hamming",mode="graph")
#plot:
plot(gd_avg_se,labels=gd_stat_se$glabels)
```

### "Single"

```{r code_folding=TRUE}

#with average cluster.method
gd_sing_se<-equiv.clust(gd_statnet, equiv.fun="sedist", cluster.method="single", method="hamming",mode="graph")

#plot:
plot(gd_sing_se,labels=gd_stat_se$glabels)

```

### "Ward.D"

```{r code_folding=TRUE}

#with average cluster.method
gd_wrd_se<-equiv.clust(gd_statnet, equiv.fun="sedist", cluster.method="ward.D", method="hamming",mode="graph")

#plot:
plot(gd_wrd_se,labels=gd_stat_se$glabels)

```

## Partition Using Clustering

I understand that the number of partitions (or roles) will depend on the height at which the dendrogram is cut. Using the tutorial example, I set the height at 15 and the result is 9 clusters. Using the alternate view from the tutorial, I also set the height at 10, and identify 10 distinct clusters.

### ward.D, Height= 15

```{r code_folding=TRUE}

#plot equivalence clustering
plot(gd_wrd_se,labels=gd_wrd_se$glabels)
#partition the clusters
rect.hclust(gd_wrd_se$cluster,h=15)
```

### ward.D, Height= 10

```{r code_folding=TRUE}

#plot equivalence clustering
plot(gd_wrd_se,labels=gd_wrd_se$glabels)
#partition the clusters
rect.hclust(gd_wrd_se$cluster,h=10)
```

### Height= 20

For my own experimenting, looking at it with a higher height ("20"), it spreads the clusters to 5.

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
#plot equivalence clustering
plot(gd_wrd_se,labels=gd_wrd_se$glabels)
#partition the clusters
rect.hclust(gd_wrd_se$cluster,h=20)
```

## Blockmodel Partitions

Inspecting the goodness of fit of the partitions that result from the clustering steps above using blockmodeling to try and get a better sense of how well the partitioning worked. Using the blockmodel command in statnet and specifying "k=x" means that "x" will indicate how many partitions to create, and "h=x" means that "x" will indicate the height to cut the dendogram.

### 2-partition blockmodel

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
#blockmodel and select partitions
blk_mod<-blockmodel(gd_statnet,gd_wrd_se,k=2)
#print blockmodel object
blk_mod
```

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
plot.block<-function(x=blk_mod, main=NULL, cex.lab=1){
  plot.sociomatrix(x$blocked.data, labels=list(x$plabels,x$plabels),
                   main=main, drawlines = FALSE, cex.lab=cex.lab)
  for (j in 2:length(x$plabels)) if (x$block.membership[j] !=
                                     x$block.membership[j-1]) 
    abline(v = j - 0.5, h = j - 0.5, lty = 3, xpd=FALSE)
}
plot.block(blk_mod,main="Grateful Dead Songwriting: 2 Partitions", cex.lab=.4)
```

### 5-partition blockmodel

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
#blockmodel and select partitions
blk_mod2<-blockmodel(gd_statnet, gd_wrd_se,k=5)
#print blockmodel object
blk_mod2$block.model
#plot blockmodel partitions
plot.block(blk_mod2,main="Grateful Dead Songwriting, 5 Partitions", cex.lab=.5)
```

## Blockmodeling Choice

In my semester assignment posts, I looked more deeply into the role and blockmodeling of the network. In the end I was able to find a model that represents the network most intuitively - the optimized 5-partition blockmodel.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#select partitions with optimization
blks3<-blockmodeling::optRandomParC(gd_projection, k=5, rep=10, approaches="ss", blocks="com")
#blockmodel with optimized partition
blk_mod3<-blockmodel(gd_projection, blks3$best$best1$clu, plabels=rownames(gd_projection)) 
#print blockmodel object
blk_mod3$block.model
plot.block(blk_mod3,main="Grateful Dead Songwriting, 5 Optimized Partitions", cex.lab=.5)
#I can assign "block.membership" as a vertex attribute to my 5-partition blockmodel for igraph
V(gd_igraph)$role<-blk_mod3$block.membership[match(V(gd_igraph)$name,blk_mod3$plabels)]
#and statnet
gd_statnet%v%"role"<-blk_mod3$block.membership[match(gd_statnet%v%"vertex.names", blk_mod3$plabels)]
#add to node dataframes
#attach role to centrality dataframe to create nodes dataframe
gd_stat_nodes$block <- blk_mod3$block.membership
gd_ig_nodes$block <- blk_mod3$block.membership
```

### Blockmodel Visualization

I can assign "block.membership" as a vertex attribute to my 5-partition blockmodel, then use the role attribute to change the color of plotted nodes in a network plot.

#### igraph

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
#plot(gd_igraph, layout=layout_with_kk, vertex.color=V(gd_igraph)$role)
```
![](ig_block.png)

#### statnet

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
#library(GGally)
#GGally::ggnet2(gd_statnet,
               #node.color="role", 
               #node.size=degree(gd_statnet, gmode="graph"),
               #node.label = "vertex.names",
               #node.alpha = .5)
```

## Community

During the semester assignments, I investigated multiple community structures and the corresponding community scores. I'll load the matrix of community modularity scores first.

```{r code_folding = TRUE}
gd_mod <- read.csv("gd_mods.csv")
gd_mod
```

On inspection of the community structures created by each algorithm, I felt that the eigenvector community best represented the network. The modularity scores of the communities confirm that this is a reasonable observation. The higher modularity scores represent divisions with dense edge connections between the vertices within a community but sparse connections between vertices in different communities ()

### Eigenvector Community Detection

This method has created 5 communities to examine with a modularity score of 0.452.

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
#Run clustering algorithm: leading eigenvector
eigen_gd <- leading.eigenvector.community(gd_igraph)
#Inspect community membership
igraph::groups(eigen_gd)
```

Igraph colors the nodes by community

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
#plot network with community coloring
plot(eigen_gd,gd_igraph)
```

### Louvain Community Clustering

One method I did not explore in the semester assignment was the Louvain clustering method. This method gives 7 communities that are somewhat unexpected, but give an interesting and valid perspective on the membership. The modularity of this method is 0.455, just above the modularity score of the eigenvector community modularity and very competitive as an option.

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
louvain <- cluster_louvain(gd_igraph)
louvain$modularity
plot(louvain,gd_igraph)
V(gd_igraph)$community <- louvain$membership
```


```{r code_folding=TRUE}
colrs <- adjustcolor( c("gray50", "tomato", "gold", "yellowgreen", "cornflowerblue", "orange"), alpha=.6)

plot(gd_igraph, vertex.color=colrs[V(gd_igraph)$community])
```









# Further Analysis

## K-core Decomposition

Finding the k-core where every node has degree of at least "k". I will add this so my node data frames before finishing up so I have that basic measure for furter analysis.

```{r}
kc <- coreness(gd_igraph, mode="all")
kc
#adding to the gd_nodes
gd_ig_nodes$kcore<-kc
gd_stat_nodes$kcore<-kc
```
