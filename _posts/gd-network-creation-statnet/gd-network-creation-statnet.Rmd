# Load Network Data

## Affiliation Matrix

Loading the dataset and creating the network to begin my analysis:

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
gd_affiliation <- read.csv('gd_affiliation_matrix.csv', row.names = 1, header = TRUE, check.names = FALSE)
gd_matrix <- as.matrix(gd_affiliation)
```

Inspecting the first 8 columns of the data structure in the affiliation matrix format: 

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
dim(gd_matrix)
gd_matrix[1:10, 1:4]
```

## Bipartite Projection

Now I can create the single mode network and examine the bipartite projection. After converting the matrix to a square adjacency matrix, I can look at the full matrix.

I can also call the adjacency matrix count for co-writing incidences between certain songwriters, such as between writing partners Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter (78) and between John Barlow and Bob Weir (21).

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
gd_projection <- gd_matrix%*%t(gd_matrix)
dim(gd_projection)
gd_projection[1:10, 1:4]
gd_projection["Jerry Garcia", "Robert Hunter"]
gd_projection["John Barlow", "Bob Weir"]
```

# Statnet Network

Coercing directly from the original affiliation matrix kept giving the error, *"Error: `loops` is `FALSE`, but `x` contains loops."*, even when I give the appropriate arguments. I tried using the "intergraph" package to convert the network object created in igraph, but it cannot coerce bipartite igraph networks. 

![](Picture1.png)

After the bipartite projection, I was able to create the statnet network object.

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
set.seed(11)
gd_statnet <- as.network(gd_projection,
               directed = FALSE, 
               bipartite = FALSE,
               loops = FALSE,
               connected = FALSE)

network.stat<-network(gd_projection, directed=F, matrix.type="adjacency") 

```

## Network Features

Looking at the features of the statnet network with the appropriate commands

```{r code_folding=TRUE}

print(gd_statnet)

network::list.vertex.attributes(gd_statnet)
network::list.edge.attributes(gd_statnet)

gd_statnet
```

### Visualization

And a first look at the basic network structure

```{r code_folding=TRUE}

plot(gd_statnet)
```

## Dyad & Triad Census

Looking at the dyad/triad census info, I have a total of 2600 triads, which is in line with the results I got in igraph as well.

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
sna::dyad.census(gd_statnet)
sna::triad.census(gd_statnet)
sum(triad.census(gd_statnet))
```

## Transitivity

Looking next at the network transitivity, I can confirm that it is the same as the igraph network transitivity score of 0.5241. 

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
gtrans(gd_statnet)
```

## Geodesic Distance

Looking at the geodesic distance tells me that on average, I can confirm that the path length in statnet is 1.93, which is not significantly different than result from igraph of 2.01.

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
gd_gd <- geodist(gd_statnet,na.omit = TRUE, ignore.eval = TRUE, inf.replace = 0)
mean(gd_gd$gdist)

```

## Components

I can determine that there is one component in the statnet network object, as in igraph - 25 songwriters in the giant component and no isolates.

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
components(gd_statnet)
```

## Density

In this case, the statnet output is far different from the igraph output of ~2.1, so I am not sure what is happening with this aspect of the calculation.

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
network.density(gd_statnet)
```

# Centrality

## Total Centrality

Calculating the total centrality degree as well as the "in-degree centrality" and "out-degree centrality" clearly uses a different scale than igraph. 

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
gd_stat_nodes <- data.frame(name=gd_statnet%v%"vertex.names",
    totdegree=sna::degree(gd_statnet),
    indegree=sna::degree(gd_statnet, cmode="indegree"),
    outdegree=sna::degree(gd_statnet, cmode="outdegree"))
rescaled_degree <- degree(gd_statnet, g=1, gmode="graph", 
        diag=FALSE, tmaxdev=FALSE, 
        cmode="freeman", rescale=TRUE)
gd_stat_nodes$rescaled <- rescaled_degree
#sort the top total degree of nodes in the stat network
arrange(gd_stat_nodes, desc(totdegree))%>%slice(1:5)
```

The statnet total degree scores are again, very different from igraph. In igraph, Jerry Garcia is the highest degree node, which gels with my hypothesis given his position as the practical and figurative head of the band and the fact that he contributed to more songs than any other songwriter.  

However, more surprising than Jerry Garcia's position in fourth in highest total degree centrality is his songwriting partner Robert Hunter's position above him in third highest. 

I can understand how Bob Weir has a high centrality despite lower song counts given his high Eigenvector centrality and betweenness status in previous igraph evaluations. However, I am surprised by his position as highest total degree and even more surprised that Phil Lesh is second highest total degree centrality overall. Both are co-founding members of the band, and did contribute to many songs written by the band, but not more than Jerry Garcia. It does not make sense to me, knowing the context and subject matter, that they are ranked higher than Jerry Garcia.

## Eigenvector Centrality

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
#calculate eigenvector centrality
eigen <- sna::evcent(gd_statnet, gmode="graph")
#add to nodes data frame
gd_stat_nodes$eigenvector <- eigen

gd_adjacency <- as.matrix(gd_statnet)
gd_adjacency_2 <- gd_adjacency %*% gd_adjacency

#calculate portion of reflected centrality
gd_reflective <- diag(as.matrix(gd_adjacency_2))/rowSums(as.matrix(gd_adjacency_2))
gd_reflective <- ifelse(is.nan(gd_reflective),0,gd_reflective)

#calculate derived centrality
gd_derived <- 1-diag(as.matrix(gd_adjacency_2))/rowSums(as.matrix(gd_adjacency_2))
gd_derived <- ifelse(is.nan(gd_derived),1,gd_derived)

#add to nodes data frame
gd_stat_nodes$eigen_derived <- gd_derived
gd_stat_nodes$eigen_reflective <- gd_reflective

#sort the top total degree of nodes in the stat network
arrange(gd_stat_nodes, desc(eigenvector))%>%slice(1:5)
```

The most immediate observations I have, is that the highest degree node in the igraph network, Jerry Garcia, was not the highest Eigenvector centrality - but in this network Bob Weir is highest both in degree and in Eigenvector centrality. The only change in the top five is that Jerry Garcia moved ahead of Robert Hunter, which makes sense.

The derived and reflective scores do not make sense - I'm not sure that the formula I used on the igraph network translates to statnet.

## Closeness

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
#calculate closeness
close <- closeness(gd_statnet, gmode="graph")
#add to nodes data frame
gd_stat_nodes$closeness <- close
#sort the top total degree of nodes in the stat network
arrange(gd_stat_nodes, desc(closeness))%>%slice(1:5)
```

The closeness scores are similar to overall degree centrality, at least in the top scores, and these are also in line with the igraph results.

## Betweenness

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
#calculate betweenness
between <- sna::betweenness(gd_statnet, gmode="graph")
#add to nodes data frame
gd_stat_nodes$betweenness <- between
#sort the top total degree of nodes in the stat network
arrange(gd_stat_nodes, desc(betweenness))%>%slice(1:5)

```

Again, when comparing these results to the igraph results, the highest degree node (Jerry Garcia) was not the node with the highest scoring betweenness. In the statnet network, the highest degree node, Bob Weir, is also the highest betweenness score, and by a significantly similar ratio to Garcia as in the igraph network evaluation.

Similarly to igraph, Pigpen jumps up in the rankings for betweenness, likely because his contributions were primarily full-band compositions.

## Bonacich Power

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
#calculate bonacich power
bonpow <- sna::bonpow(gd_statnet, gmode="graph")
#add to nodes data frame
gd_stat_nodes$bonacich <- bonpow
#sort the top total degree of nodes in the stat network
arrange(gd_stat_nodes, desc(bonacich))%>%slice(1:5)
write.csv(gd_stat_nodes, file = "gd_stat_nodes.csv")
```

### Add as Attributes

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
gd_statnet %v% "degree"<- degree(gd_statnet)       # Degree centrality
gd_statnet %v% "eigenvector"<- evcent(gd_statnet)       # Eigenvector centrality
gd_statnet %v% "closeness"<- closeness(gd_statnet)    # Closeness centrality
gd_statnet %v% "betweenness"<- betweenness(gd_statnet)  # Vertex betweenness centrality
gd_statnet %v% "bonacich"<- bonpow(gd_statnet) # Bonacich power
```

## Correlations of Centrality Measures

```{r code_folding=TRUE}
correlations <- gd_stat_nodes %>% 
  select(totdegree,eigenvector,betweenness,closeness,bonacich)%>%
  correlate() %>%
  rearrange()
fashion(correlations)
```
