There is much more to study with regard to the network of songwriters contributing to the Grateful Dead original song catalog. Beyond that, there is a world of research available on the larger social networks orbiting the Grateful Dead. 

For DACSS 697E, Social and Political Network Analysis, I feel confident I have gleaned the tools to begin scratching the surface of those networks. For a course summary, this project page and corresponding presentation poster serve as a representaton of that journey. I am grateful for this opportunity to explore this topic in new ways and plan to continue doing so in the future.
